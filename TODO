* README
* review precision dispatching mechanism:
  * add more flexible method to list set of float types suitable to dispatch
  * find some way to simplify generic datastructures following CRTP
* write threading dispatching mechanism with flexible method to list set of threading models suitable to dispatch
* thread pool for std::thread/pthreads
* some generic parallelisable constructs(i.e. map/reduce) for threading dispatcher
+- BUILD_VANILLA review
* BUILD_THREADING review
* progress bar and logger logic review
* cli parsing review, further reduce copypasting
* implement (some) standard cblas interfaces
* write tests and scripts to automate running them
* write build tests for at least 27 build variants:
  3(linux/os x/win) * 3(basic/full/vanilla) * 3(gnu/intel/clang/msvc compiler)
* test compilation on ibm/pgi/pathscale compilers
* add support for gziped i/o via boost::iostreams
* add extra third parties for tests: GSL, FFTW, PETSc, Hypre/BoomerAMG, SuiteSparse,
  CGAL, libFLAME/BLIS(https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~flame/web/),
  TiledArray(https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray) etc
* add generic framework to test matrix algorithms on matrices from some well-known matrix collections:
  - https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/
  - http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/collections/hb.html
  etc...
